### Group Project: Browse Datasets

Visit the UCI Machine Learning Dataset [Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

Spend 10-15mins looking at datasets.  

Read a dataset into python, show some records, and make a graph.

Hint: For some online datasets, they can be directly read into python by passing the URL to `pd.read_csv`:

`df = pd.read_csv("https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/abalone/abalone.data")`
